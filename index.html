<h1>Named After Me</h1>
<p title = "Proposal" >What I'd like to do is utilize a website like "GoDaddy" to get my own domain that I can use for one of my own projects.</p>
<h1>Team Involved</h1>
<p title = "Team" >I (Trevor Goode) will most likely be working on this project by myself.</p>

<h1>What is the Goal?</h1>
<p title="My Goal">What I am hoping to accomplish is to take my "Getting To Know Each Other" website, make it look nicer, possibly adding more functionality, and to change its public domain name to one that is more personal to me.</p>
<h2>Priorities</h2>
<ol type = "1">
<li>Get custom domain (most likely from GoDaddy)</li>  
<li>Make website look cleaner/more aesthetically pleasing</li>
<li>Change picture to what I originally wanted</li>
<li>Possibly add cool features like working tabs</li>
</ol>
